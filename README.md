# Project Title: Airbnb Amsterdam Data Analysis and Visualization

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Airbnb Amsterdam Data Analysis and Visualization project. This project is a part of the "Intro to Numpy and Pandas" course. Below, you will find links to access the project notebook and the Streamlit app for visualizing the data.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will be working with Airbnb data for Amsterdam. The goal is to clean and preprocess the dataset using NumPy and Pandas and then create an interactive app using Streamlit for data visualization. We will also perform currency conversion and apply inflation rates to the prices.

## Week 1: Clean the Airbnb Dataset and Deploy It!

### Project Tasks

1. Downloading the Dataset
   - Install necessary packages and download the dataset.

2. Preprocessing the Dataset
   - Find the delimiter in the CSV file and set the data type.
   - Remove unnecessary rows and columns.
   - Reformat the dataset.

3. Currency Conversion
   - Convert prices from USD to your chosen currency (e.g., GBP).

4. Inflation Adjustment
   - Apply the 2022 annual inflation rate to the prices.

5. Rounding Prices
   - Round prices to two decimal places.

6. Calculate Distance
   - Calculate the distance in meters from a chosen location for each Airbnb listing.

7. Create a Streamlit App
   - Visualize the dataset and the calculated distances on an interactive map.
   - Filter listings based on price and display them in a DataFrame.

### Additional Information
